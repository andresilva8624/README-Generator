# README-Generator

The goal is to create a README Generator with Node.js. It asks your project title and description, installation and test intrutions, usage and credits, gives you 4 license options and finally asks for your GitHub username and your email address rendering a REAME.md file with a badge. Enjoy! ðŸ˜€
